				<p> Hi. My name is Arpit Saluja. A computer <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">engineer</span> enthusiast. Engineering just sounds too geeky for me &#128556;</p>
				<img src="bull.jpg" alt="Mine" width="460.8.2" height="345.6"title="GO BULLS!!" > 
				<p>I have loved computers since I remember how to use them.
				Everything around us is a computer these days; we depend on computers and that is what drove me to study it.</p>
				<p>I am studying Computer Engineering at the University of South Florida (GO BULLS!)&#128002;</p>
				
				<p>I started my coding journey in college and felt like I had lots of catching up to do since I knew people who had been doing it since high school. It's funny, I look back at my first coding class, and the struggle I went through while everyone else thought it was a breeze. Though this only pushed me to master it even more. During my time in college I have had the opportunity to learn new and exciting concepts in the world of computer science and engineering, ranging from java/c++ data structures/algorithms, to designing small scale databases, to even designing CMOS technology chips (like the ones they make at INTEL!). Scroll down if you want to read more about these projects. 
				<p> As you can see I am interested in developing on this powerful platform called the "INTERNET". I don't know what part of the world you are in, but the fact that you are able to read this wherever you are shows how powerful the internet and technology in general is, and how pwerful you could be if you learn it like me &#128521; </p>
				<p> I am originally Indian, but spent most of my life in a lesser known country in Africa called Tanzania. Home to Mt. Kilimanjaro, the tallest peak in Africa, and the Zanzibar island, that has some of the most beautiful beaches in the world, Tanzania is an exquisite country. After high school, I did find a new home, Tampa FL. It's beautiful weather and beaches did not make me miss Tanzania too much, and my time at university has flown by. I am currently finishing up my senior year here at the University of South Florida, and looking to use my various skills at a tech-hungry company. Think I could be a good fit at your company? <a href="#connect">Connect</a> with me now!

			<p>Q. What do you do like to do in your free time ?<p>
			<p>A. Apart from sleep, I do like to explore the outdoors. I am a nature lover and can not take enough pictures of sunsets. Here's one of them</p> 
			<img src="sunset.jpg" alt="Mine" width="405" height="300"title="Ruaha National Park" > 
			<p>Q. Why did you choose the US for university? </p>
			<p>A. I had a craze to come to the United States, and a craze for technology. Combine those two together and I think you have your answer</p>
			<h3 class="project-tagline"></h3>

			<p>Q. How many languages can you speak? </p>
			<p>A. I would say 3 and a half, English, Hindi, Kiswahili (Tanzania and Kenya's local language) and I guess I could get myself around in France </p>
			<h3 class="project-tagline"></h3>

			<p>Q. What is your special talent? </p>
			<p>A. I think I can blow some pretty big bubblegum bubbles. Yes I have been told to stop at the library a few times &#128523;</p>
